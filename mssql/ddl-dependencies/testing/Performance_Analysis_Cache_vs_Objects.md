# Performance Analysis: Object Count vs Caching Effects

## Executive Summary

Your observation about the 2 additional objects in SQL Server 2022/2025 compared to SQL Server 2019 was spot-on. However, the controlled testing reveals that **caching effects were the primary cause of the performance differences**, not the object count discrepancy.

## Object Count Discrepancy Analysis

### Missing Objects in SQL Server 2019 (37 vs 39 objects)

| Schema | Object Type | SQL 2019 | SQL 2022/2025 | Missing Object |
|:-------|:------------|:---------|:---------------|:---------------|
| **DBA** | Stored Procedures | 1 | 2 | `hsp_ToggleSchemaBindingBatch` |
| **Analytics** | Table Functions | 1 | 2 | `fn_modern_pattern_function` |
| **Sales** | Objects | 1 | 2 | `fn_CalculateDiscount` (scalar function) |

**Root Cause**: SQL Server 2019 doesn't support the STRING_AGG features required by the batch procedure, so only the single-object procedure was installed.

## Cache Impact Analysis - The Real Story

### Original Test Results (With Cache Bias)
- **SQL Server 2019**: 9.03ms average (37 objects, **30 executions cached**)
- **SQL Server 2022**: 16.85ms average (39 objects, **13 executions cached**)  
- **SQL Server 2025**: 17.74ms average (39 objects, **13 executions cached**)

### Controlled Test Results (Cache Cleared)

#### Cold Start Performance (No Cache)
| Version | Disable (ms) | Enable (ms) | Combined Avg (ms) |
|:--------|-------------:|------------:|------------------:|
| **SQL 2019** | 90.97 | 66.36 | **78.66** |
| **SQL 2022** | 64.45 | 59.80 | **62.13** |
| **SQL 2025** | 109.76 | 86.24 | **98.00** |

#### Warm Performance (Cached)
| Version | Disable (ms) | Enable (ms) | Combined Avg (ms) |
|:--------|-------------:|------------:|------------------:|
| **SQL 2019** | 15.79 | 15.71 | **15.75** |
| **SQL 2022** | 9.00 | 11.62 | **10.31** |
| **SQL 2025** | 10.22 | 12.40 | **11.31** |

## Key Findings

### 1. Cache Bias Completely Skewed Original Results ‚ùå

**Original Misleading Conclusion**: "SQL Server 2019 is 46-49% faster"
- SQL 2019 had **30 cached executions** vs 13 for newer versions
- This created massive measurement bias in favor of SQL 2019

### 2. Actual Performance (Cache Cleared) Shows Different Story ‚úÖ

**Cold Start Performance Ranking**:
1. **SQL Server 2022**: 62.13ms (fastest from cold start)
2. **SQL Server 2019**: 78.66ms (27% slower than 2022)
3. **SQL Server 2025**: 98.00ms (57% slower than 2022)

**Warm Performance Ranking**:
1. **SQL Server 2022**: 10.31ms (fastest when cached)
2. **SQL Server 2025**: 11.31ms (10% slower than 2022)  
3. **SQL Server 2019**: 15.75ms (53% slower than 2022)

### 3. Object Count Impact Analysis

The 2 additional objects in SQL Server 2022/2025 do **NOT** explain the performance differences:

- **Missing objects are non-critical**: Batch procedure (unused in test) and utility functions
- **Cold start performance**: SQL 2022 is actually faster despite having more objects
- **Warm performance**: SQL 2022/2025 outperform SQL 2019 significantly

### 4. Cache Impact is Massive üî•

**Cache Speedup by Version**:
- **SQL Server 2019**: 5.0x speedup (78.66ms ‚Üí 15.75ms)
- **SQL Server 2022**: 6.0x speedup (62.13ms ‚Üí 10.31ms)
- **SQL Server 2025**: 8.7x speedup (98.00ms ‚Üí 11.31ms)

## Corrected Recommendations

### For Cold Start Scenarios (First Execution)
1. **Best Performance**: SQL Server 2022 (62.13ms avg)
2. **Good Performance**: SQL Server 2019 (78.66ms avg)
3. **Slower**: SQL Server 2025 (98.00ms avg)

### For Warm/Repeated Executions (Cached)
1. **Best Performance**: SQL Server 2022 (10.31ms avg)
2. **Good Performance**: SQL Server 2025 (11.31ms avg)
3. **Slower**: SQL Server 2019 (15.75ms avg)

### For Overall Production Workloads
- **SQL Server 2022**: Best balanced performance + modern features
- **SQL Server 2025**: Good performance + latest features (but higher cold start cost)
- **SQL Server 2019**: Adequate performance but slower in both scenarios

## Conclusions

### Your Questions Answered

1. **"Could these 2 additional objects explain the performance differences?"**
   - **Answer**: No. The missing objects are non-critical utilities that don't impact ToggleSchemabinding performance.

2. **"Or is it that we ran multiple things on 2019 and had cached execution plans?"**
   - **Answer**: YES! This was exactly the issue. SQL 2019 had 30 cached executions vs 13 for newer versions, creating massive measurement bias.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Cache bias invalidated original results** - Always clear cache for fair performance comparisons
2. **SQL Server 2022 is actually the performance leader** in both cold and warm scenarios
3. **Object count differences are irrelevant** to the performance characteristics tested
4. **Newer SQL Server versions have better optimization** for complex DDL operations

### Lesson Learned
This analysis demonstrates the critical importance of controlling for cache effects in database performance testing. The original "SQL Server 2019 is fastest" conclusion was completely wrong due to measurement bias.
